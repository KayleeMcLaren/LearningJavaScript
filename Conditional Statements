<!-- Conditional Statements: if, else, else if

There are mainly three types of conditional statements in JavaScript:

1. if Statement: An ‘if’ statement executes code based on a condition
2. if… else Statement: The if… else statement consists of two blocks of code; when a condition is true 
it executes the first block of code and when the condition is false, it executes the second block of code
3. if… else if… else Statement: When multiple conditions need to be tested and different blocks of code need to 
be executed based on which condition is true
